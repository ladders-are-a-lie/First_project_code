# First_project_code
The experiment performed was conducted to explore the effect of different liquid densities
on the velocity of a steel sphere falling through them. The setup consisted of a 2.5-inch tube filled with
500 mL of the varying liquids: water (486g), corn syrup (662g), peanut oil (441g), and dish soap (496g).
Additionally, two sensors were positioned on the outside of the tube, near the top and the bottom. In
the tube, a steel ball was held in position above the initial sensor with a magnet and released so it
would fall through the bottom sensor. These sensors were set to record the velocities at both points
and the change in time between the data recorded using the SparkVue app. This experiment was
conducted for at least ten drop trials in each liquid to gather the sufficient data needed for analysis.
